## ROADMAP

### Done
* Initial core
* Integration with [ch](https://github.com/LdDl/ch)

### W.I.P
* REST server side (and store it in folder cmd/)
    * Map matching
    * Shortest path finder(we are trying to avoid word "routing")

### Planned
* Cool logo :) PR's are welcome, haha.
* Some kind of wiki
* Front-end integrated with server-side. Probably via [Mapbox](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js) + [VueJS](https://github.com/vuejs/vue)
* gRPC server side (and store it in folder cmd/) with same features as REST
* Stable core
* Contributing guidelines

### Continuous activity
* README
* Benchmarks and tests
* Examples
* [Horizon](cmd/horizon) itself
